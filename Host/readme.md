# Host in ASP.NET Core

[Back to Microsoft_Samples Home](../readme.md)

.NET apps configure and launch a host. The host is responsible for app startup and lifetime management. Two host APIs are available for use:

* [Generic Host](GenericHost_ConsoleApp/readme.md)  
* [Web Host with DI Service lifetime example](WebHost_WebApplication/readme.md)
